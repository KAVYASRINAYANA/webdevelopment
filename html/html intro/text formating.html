    <h4>
        Everyone <b>adores and admires</b> the ideal students. It is<i> because they excel</i> in all areas of their lives. <s>Every student</s> wishes to communicate with or form friendships with ideal students. No child is ideal by birth; the ideal qualities develop in a child depending on their upbringing.<br> A child can be called <u>an ideal child</u>if they are guided in a proper manner and majorly by their parents. A parent’s role in a child’s life can never be compared with <mark>any other relationship</mark>.
        <p>People think that a <em>child who studies</em> well is an ideal student, but in fact,<del> an ideal student</del> is one who is attentive in class, adores everyone, is very respectful and is hardworking and trustworthy h<sub>20</sub>. An ideal student is not one who spends all the time with the notebooks but also participates in other co-curricular activities and various volunteer h<sup>20</sup> activities.</p>
         Some of the qualities of an ideal student can be <small>hardworking, trustworthy</small>, loyal, determined, curious to learn, etc. A child who can score good numbers and is respectful enough will be appreciated throughout life. A child may score the highest percentage but is not compliant; then, there is no use for <big>the acquired knowledge</big>. The youth are the future of our nation. An ideal student grows up with high ambitions and creates a positive circle around themselves. An ideal child becomes an example for society and inspires the young generations. If you are hardworking, then your younger generation will also be motivated and become hard-working. So spend time with your parents and let them know all your issues to find a better solution.
