    Co-education is an educational system in which boys and girls attend the same school or college. Co-education was uncommon in ancient times. It is a radical concept. Parents supported the case for adequate education for all children, regardless of gender. The countrymen realised that in the free world, boys and girls must move together and work hand in hand in all aspects of life. They began sending their children to co-educational schools. Co-education encourages competition among boys and girls through the activities they participate in at school. That is why students at co-educational institutions perform better in all aspects of their lives.
